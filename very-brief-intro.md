**A Very Brief, Non-technical Overview of Our Mission**

We are building a free, decentralized, and open-source data network
for the Internet of Things here in NYC. We are working with our European
colleagues who founded The Things Network Foundation in Netherlands last year, 
and are part of a movement to launch the network across the Americas.
